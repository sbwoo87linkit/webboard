<h3>
    About the SDGs</h3>

<p>
    In September 2015, world leaders attended a special summit at the United Nations in New York to adopt
    <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld"
        target="_blank">Agenda 2030</a>, including the Sustainable Development Goals (or SDGs). The 17 goals succeed the Millennium Development
    Goals, forged in 2000. They provide a holistic framework, applicable to all countries, aiming to eradicate poverty and
    deprivation, but also to grow our economies, to protect our environment, and to promote peace and good governance.

</div>
<p>
    The goals were developed over more than 3 years of intergovernmental negotiations. The SDSN contributed to the intergovernmental
    negotiation leading to the SDGs through flagship reports (
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/an-action-agenda-for-sustainable-development/"
        target="_blank">The Action Agenda</a> and
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/indicators/" target="_blank">Indicators and a Monitoring Framework for the SDGs</a>), briefs and evidence
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/publication/type/sdgs/" target="_blank">papers</a>, and expert sessions and side
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/get-involved/events/" target="_blank">events</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Although the SDGs have been agreed, work continues focusing on defining the indicators and monitoring framework, as well
    as the political processes of follow-up and review. SDSN is participates in these discussions through
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/" target="_blank">expert analysis</a> and
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/news/" target="_blank">events</a>.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started with SDG Implementation</h3>

<p>All work by the SDSN is focused on supporting the implementation of the Agenda 2030, including the Paris Agreement on climate
    change. During 2016, countries are starting the process of applying the SDGs to their local needs, identifying priorities,
    and implementing the Agenda 2030. The SDSN Guide on
    <a href="https://sdg.guide/" target="_blank">Getting Started with the SDGs</a> outlines ideas and suggestions for initiating the implementation of Agenda 2030 at
    the national level. National and Regional SDSNs and the Thematic Networks support discussions on getting started with
    the SDGs.</p>


<h3>Data, Indicators, and Follow-up & Review</h3>
<p>
    The success or failure of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will depend, in large part, upon effective monitoring.
    Well crafted indicators and high quality data will give governments, businesses, academia, and civil society the information
    they need to target resources, policies, and programs. Good quality data will enable us to track progress on our objectives
    over time, and to change course if we veer off track.
</p>

<p>
    In Agenda 2030, governments have committed to provide for systematic follow-up and review at global, regional, and national
    levels. In particular the High Level Political Forum, under the auspices of the General Assembly and the Economic and
    Social Council, will have the central role in overseeing follow-up and review at the global level. Indicators are being
    developed to assist this work, recognising that “
    <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld" target="_blank">quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data will be needed to help with the measurement of progress and
        to ensure that no one is left behind</a>” (Agenda 2030, para. 48).

<p>
    A sound indicator framework will turn the SDGs and their targets into a management tool to help countries develop implementation
    strategies and allocate resources accordingly, as well as a report card to measure progress towards sustainable development
    and help ensure the accountability of all stakeholders for achieving the SDGs. The mechanics of SDG monitoring are still
    being worked out, but it is clear that the focus of SDG monitoring will be at the national level. Complementary monitoring
    will occur at regional and global levels, as well as among thematic epistemic communities. SDSN has been at the forefront
    of discussions on a robust set of indicators for the SDGs, including through our report “
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/indicators/">Indicators and a Monitoring Framework for the SDGs</a>.”
</p>

<p>
    Conducting high quality monitoring and producing reliable data requires common standards, strong data systems and adequate
    capacity. Governments will need to undertake comprehensive needs assessments of their statistical capacity and readiness
    in order to monitor the agenda. In the
    <a href="http://unsdsn.org/resources/publications/a-needs-assessment-for-sdg-monitoring-and-statistical-capacity-development/"
        target="_blank">Data for Development</a> report, SDSN quantifies investment needs in administrative data and high-frequency and real-time
    data systems to support effective decision-making.
</p>
<p>
    The unprecedented rate of innovation in data collection techniques and technologies and the capacity to distribute data widely
    and freely has expanded the horizon of possible sources and uses of data. The adoption of the SDGs presents a strategic
    opportunity to build on the momentum of the data revolution and demonstrate the central role of data in eradicating poverty
    and promoting sustainable development. SDSN is proud to be a founding partner of the
    <a href="http://www.data4sdgs.org/" target="_blank">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)</a>– a global network of governments, NGOs and businesses
    working together to create more, open usable data for decision-making in response to the challenge of sustainable development.
